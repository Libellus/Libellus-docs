Operating Phase
******************************

*Absence log* - Keep a log on who is in and out. Use the chat or create a new journal entry to keep track of this. This functionality can be compared to using a whiteboard, but remember that Libellus will preserve this information for the posterity.

*Big screens* - There should be one or two projectors or big screens, that displays either the journal or the actions view, but preferably both. This is to get a better overview for everyone.

*The Devil’s advocate* - When working in a group, especially in a group where people haven’t worked as much with each other before, the concept of being completely up in the air may occur. This is when everyone in the group are in bliss and peace, and every suggestion is met with only positive energy. This is when one person in the group should have the role as The Devils advocate. His role should be to argue in every step of the decision making. This way, the most obvious and brilliant plan, may not be that good after all.

*Point of no return* - Sometimes a decision must be taken before a given time. This is defined as the point of no return. Libellus supports this by the action functionality.

*Reliability* - Every incoming information should be verified. Consider how reliable the information should be before it is entered into Libellus. If you enter unverified information, write that the data can not be trusted as for now. Then write a comment when the information is validated.
