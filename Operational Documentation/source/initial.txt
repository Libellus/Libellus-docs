Initial Phase
*************************************
*Intern first statement* - Agree upon what type of crisis this is, and how much information that can be shared. This statement should be entered as one of the first journal entries in Libellus. Release the statement to other employees to inform them what is going on. If the crisis is of a such nature that media should be informed, use your public relations manager and go public with a press release. Do this to control the information sent to the media. 

*Set the time* - This might not be the first thing that comes to mind when a crisis occurs, but It is important that everyone has the same time. Make sure everybody has the same time on their wristwatches and cell phones. It is also very important that all have the same local time on their computer, so that Libellus logs every event in the correct time. 

*Initiate Libellus* - Start Libellus.

*Check who is online* - In the chat view in Libellus, you can see who is online. Check for screen names that should not be there. This is in the relations to the USB sections in the initial phase, that there might be other employees that are running the software that should not.

*Clear the room* - Remove everyone in the room that doesn’t need to be there. This is to keep a more calm environment when taking important decisions. Another reason for this is that the more heads that want a say in the decision making, more delay will occur when going back and forth on actions to be taken. To make a lesser good decision is better to not make a decision at all, but one person should have the role as The Devil’s advocate when he can. 

*Define terms* - “Happening Time” in Libellus can be ambiguous. It can either be the start time of the event or the end time. The default classifications has some captions, for instance releasable to partners and releasable to trusted partners. It’s important that everyone knows the difference. Not that the Libellus software handles the data different, but other staff members might.
