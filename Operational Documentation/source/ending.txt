Ending phase
*************************
*Backup* - Take a backup if the database file and keep its integrity. These backups might be transferred back into Libellus and viewed as before. The crisis or event might end up in court, then it is very important that you have evidence for what was done, in what time, based upon what you knew. The integrity must be intact if used as evidence. To do this, you can burn and archive the database files on a CD, and only allow access to trusted employees.

*Evaluation* - Walk through the journal log. Ask critical questions, like why did the one in charge make the decision he or she did and what could be done better. In the military, especially in Norway, they do this regularly. This is good practise, but must be performed right. None should feel that they are under the loupe and be afraid, or then this session works against its purpose.

*Reinstall* - When you have taken backup of the database files, the USB sticks should be formated and a new installation should be downloaded from the Libellus website and copied to the USB sticks, ready to use for a new crisis.
