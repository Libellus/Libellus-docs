<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This operational documentation is divided into four stages of an crisis or event and will be described in further in detail.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Preperations</li>
<li>Initial</li>
<li>Operating phase</li>
<li>Ending phase</li>

<h2>Preperations<a class="headerlink" href="#preperations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>USB sticks</em> - The Libellus software should already be installed on USB sticks beforehand. To begin with the installation when the crisis occurs, creates unnecessary stress and delay. The amount of pre installed USB sticks is up to the organization to decide. They need to think about how many people are going to run the software, and then add a couple of backup sticks. If the organization think they will have two instances of Libellus running, they should then have at least four USB sticks ready.</p>
<p><em>USB encryption</em> - There exist USB sticks with hardware encryption, where you have input buttons on the device to enter the pin code or password to open the USB stick. If anyone get the hold of one of the USB sticks, they can see everything that is going on in Libellus. The upside is that they can only see the traffic if they are in the same local network, and if the RSA keys are updated regularly, the USB sticks they are in hold of are useless. The downside of using USB encryption is that someone needs to remember the password or be written somewhere. It can be devastating if the person that knows the password is not at work that day.</p>
<p><em>RSA keys</em> - Libellus ships with a pair of default keys. If the organization is only planning to use the software locally with no synchronization over the Internet, the updating of the keys is not that important. The exception is that if anyone internally gets a hold of an USB stick and plug it into the local network, they will be a part of Libellus and see all the content if he has the same key pair. We still recommend a routine for the updating the keys in a given interval.</p>
<p><em>Define staff</em> - In a military or big organization, there usually exist a staff beforehand. The military uses the special staff structure where you have officers for personnel (S1), intelligence and security (S2), operations (S3), logistics (S4), plans (S5), signals (S6), training (S7), finance (S8) and CIMIC (relations to civil affairs) (S9). A big civil concern normally uses the basic corporate structure of Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Chief Security Officer (CSO) and so on. In smaller organizations, these roles may not be defined as concretely and some might not exist at all, but under a crisis everyone should have a defined role. Who leads the crisis event. Who should write journal notes. Who is the contact person to different actors etc.</p>
<p><em>Training</em> - When a crisis occurs, even the simplest task becomes more complicated and difficult under stress. We strongly recommend to perform test scenarios as often as possible, to remove the factor where everyone needs to learn a new software while the building is burning, and meet real events with one more confidence.</p>

<h2>Initial Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Intern first statement</em> - Agree upon what type of crisis this is, and how much information that can be shared. This statement should be entered as one of the first journal entries in Libellus. Release the statement to other employees to inform them what is going on. If the crisis is of a such nature that media should be informed, use your public relations manager and go public with a press release. Do this to control the information sent to the media.</p>
<p><em>Set the time</em> - This might not be the first thing that comes to mind when a crisis occurs, but It is important that everyone has the same time. Make sure everybody has the same time on their wristwatches and cell phones. It is also very important that all have the same local time on their computer, so that Libellus logs every event in the correct time.</p>
<p><em>Initiate Libellus</em> - Start Libellus.</p>
<p><em>Check who is online</em> - In the chat view in Libellus, you can see who is online. Check for screen names that should not be there. This is in the relations to the USB sections in the initial phase, that there might be other employees that are running the software that should not.</p>
<p><em>Clear the room</em> - Remove everyone in the room that doesn’t need to be there. This is to keep a more calm environment when taking important decisions. Another reason for this is that the more heads that want a say in the decision making, more delay will occur when going back and forth on actions to be taken. To make a lesser good decision is better to not make a decision at all, but one person should have the role as The Devil’s advocate when he can.</p>
<p><em>Define terms</em> - “Happening Time” in Libellus can be ambiguous. It can either be the start time of the event or the end time. The default classifications has some captions, for instance releasable to partners and releasable to trusted partners. It’s important that everyone knows the difference. Not that the Libellus software handles the data different, but other staff members might.</p>

<h2>Operating Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#operating-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Absence log</em> - Keep a log on who is in and out. Use the chat or create a new journal entry to keep track of this. This functionality can be compared to using a whiteboard, but remember that Libellus will preserve this information for the posterity.</p>
<p><em>Big screens</em> - There should be one or two projectors or big screens, that displays either the journal or the actions view, but preferably both. This is to get a better overview for everyone.</p>
<p><em>The Devil’s advocate</em> - When working in a group, especially in a group where people haven’t worked as much with each other before, the concept of being completely up in the air may occur. This is when everyone in the group are in bliss and peace, and every suggestion is met with only positive energy. This is when one person in the group should have the role as The Devils advocate. His role should be to argue in every step of the decision making. This way, the most obvious and brilliant plan, may not be that good after all.</p>
<p><em>Point of no return</em> - Sometimes a decision must be taken before a given time. This is defined as the point of no return. Libellus supports this by the action functionality.</p>
<p><em>Reliability</em> - Every incoming information should be verified. Consider how reliable the information should be before it is entered into Libellus. If you enter unverified information, write that the data can not be trusted as for now. Then write a comment when the information is validated.</p>

<span id="document-ending"></span><div class="section" id="ending-phase">
<h2>Ending phase<a class="headerlink" href="#ending-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Backup</em> - Take a backup if the database file and keep its integrity. These backups might be transferred back into Libellus and viewed as before. The crisis or event might end up in court, then it is very important that you have evidence for what was done, in what time, based upon what you knew. The integrity must be intact if used as evidence. To do this, you can burn and archive the database files on a CD, and only allow access to trusted employees.</p>
<p><em>Evaluation</em> - Walk through the journal log. Ask critical questions, like why did the one in charge make the decision he or she did and what could be done better. In the military, especially in Norway, they do this regularly. This is good practise, but must be performed right. None should feel that they are under the loupe and be afraid, or then this session works against its purpose.</p>
<p><em>Reinstall</em> - When you have taken backup of the database files, the USB sticks should be formated and a new installation should be downloaded from the Libellus website and copied to the USB sticks, ready to use for a new crisis.</p>
