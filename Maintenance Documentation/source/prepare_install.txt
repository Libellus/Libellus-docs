How to Prepare and Install Libellus to a USB stick
*************************************************************
Use a USB stick with at least 8 GB of storage space.
Libellus itself uses approximately 300 MB of space, and the rest will be used for the logging data.

Format the device to the exFAT file system. This filesystem is used for cross compatibility between Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh systems. It also has support for files larger than 4 GB.

Download the newest portable version of Libellus from libellus.no.
Extract the whole package into the root directory of the USB stick
