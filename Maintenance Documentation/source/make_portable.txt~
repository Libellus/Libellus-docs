Making CouchDB Windows Portable
*************************************************
You might want to upgrade the installation if a new release of CouchDB is available.
Notice: This step requires some degree of technical knowledge and is not a complete how-to.

* Download the official *CouchDB* Windows installer from couchdb.org
* Install the application to a known location, eg your desktop.
* You will also need the DLLs from The Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package. 
* Edit the file erl.ini located in CouchDB/bin

* Replace the old config with::

    [erlang]
    Bindir=..\\erts-5.8.5\\bin
    Progname=erl
    Rootdir=..

* In this case the erts version is 5.8.5, edit accordingly.
* Do the same with the file erl.ini located in CouchDB\erts-5.8.5\bin
* Paste the DLLs from Redistributable Package into the /bin and erts-5.8.5/\bin folder.
* You should then test the application in a complete clean environment, like a virtual machine with no extra installed DLLs.
