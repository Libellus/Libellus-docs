CouchDB Configuration File
*********************************

Each operating system (Windows and OS X) has its own binary-files for CouchDB, the same goes for configuration files.

For Windows, the configuration files are located in *libellus/portable_scripts/windows_database/CouchDB/etc/couchdb*

The file local.ini contains an uuid that is generated on startup of Libellus by the script *generate_uuidconfig.py*. This is to uniquely identify each running instance of Libellus.

*default.ini* contains all the specific configuration that is in use. All the lines of the configuration is commented, and will not be repeated here.
