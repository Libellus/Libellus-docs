Update Private/Public Key Pair
**************************************

Libellus uses a self-signed certificate. We strongly recommend that every company that uses Libellus generate their own key pair. This can be done in the following way on an UNIX like operating system::

    $ openssl genrsa > server_cert.pem
    $ openssl req -new -x509 -key server_cert.pem -out server_key.pem -days 1095

Place the two files in */libellus/config/cert*
